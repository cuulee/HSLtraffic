# HSLtraffic

Scripts to create a PostgreSQL database for HSL GTFS-data.

Data can be downloaded as zip-archives from http://dev.hsl.fi/gtfs/.

The files inside zip follow Google's GTFS-guidelines for public transport (at least to some level), descriptions here: https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/

A rough schema diagram as an image can be found in this directory.

I tested these and created a sample video with QGIS Time Manager -plugin, going to add the route segments between stops to get a bit more calm animation as next version.
